1 Implement Feed-forward Neural Network and train the network with
different optimizers and compare the results.

2 Write a Program to implement regularization to prevent the model from
overfitting.

3 Implement deep learning for recognizing classes for datasets like CIFAR10 images for previously unseen images and assign them to one of the 10
classes.

4 Implement deep learning for the Prediction of the autoencoder from the
test data (e.g. MNIST data set).

5 Implement Convolutional Neural Network for Digit Recognition on the
MNIST Dataset.

6 Write a program to implement Transfer Learning on the suitable dataset
(e.g. classify the cats versus dogs dataset from Kaggle).

7 Write a program for the Implementation of a Generative Adversarial
Network for generating synthetic shapes (like digits)

8 Write a program to implement a simple form of a recurrent neural network.
E.g. (4-to-1 RNN) to show that the quantity of rain on a certain day
also depends on the values of the previous day

9 Implement LSTM for sentiment analysis on datasets like UMICH SI650 for
similar.

10 Write a program for object detection from the image/video
