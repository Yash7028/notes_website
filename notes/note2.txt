nslookup
> set type=a
> ns1.bluehost.com

These commands primarily use ping, tracert, and nslookup to test network connectivity, measure response times, and gather DNS information. Here's a breakdown:

1. Basic Ping Test

ping www.certifiedhacker.com

Sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to www.certifiedhacker.com.

Measures round-trip time (RTT) to check if the host is reachable.

---

2. Ping with Large Packet Size

ping www.certifiedhacker.com -f -l 1500
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -f -l 1300
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -f -l 1473
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -f -l 1472

-f → Sets the Do Not Fragment (DF) flag, preventing packet fragmentation.

-l <size> → Specifies packet size in bytes.

Purpose:

Tests the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).

If packets are too large for a network path, they will be dropped.

The correct MTU is typically 1472 bytes (1500 - 28 for headers).

3. Ping with Time-to-Live (TTL) Values

ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 3
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 2 -n 1
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 3 -n 1
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 4 -n 1
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 15 -n 1
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 20 -n 1
ping www.certifiedhacker.com -i 24 -n 1

-i <TTL> → Sets Time-To-Live (TTL) value for the packet.

-n 1 → Sends only one ping request.

Purpose:

TTL limits how far a packet can travel before being discarded.

Useful for tracing the network path to the target.

---

4. Traceroute (Tracing Network Path)

tracert www.certifiedhacker.com

Sends ICMP packets with increasing TTL values to trace each hop along the route.

Purpose:

Identifies network bottlenecks or packet loss

---

5. DNS Lookup with nslookup

nslookup
> set type=a
> ns1.bluehost.com

nslookup → Opens the interactive DNS lookup mode.

set type=a → Requests A records (IPv4 addresses).

ns1.bluehost.com → Queries the nameserver ns1.bluehost.com for an A record.

Purpose:

Resolves domain names to IPs.

Checks if a domain has an A record at Bluehost's nameserver


Ping tests network connectivity, MTU, and TTL limits.

Traceroute maps the path to the destination.
