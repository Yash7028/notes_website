prac 4: vulnerability scanning and assessment

sudo nmap -sV -p21-8080 --script vulners 192.68.0.102

======================================================
nikto -h scanner.nmap.org
nikto -h https://nmap.org -ssl
nikto -h 172.16.6.117
cat > domain.txt 
scanme.nmap.org
nmap.org

nikto -h domain.txt
nikto -h nmap.org -o scan.txt

These commands involve using Nikto, a web server vulnerability scanner, to scan various targets. Let’s break them down step by step:

1. nikto -h scanner.nmap.org

nikto → Runs the Nikto web scanner.

-h scanner.nmap.org → Specifies the target hostname (scanner.nmap.org).

Purpose: Scans scanner.nmap.org for vulnerabilities.



---

2. nikto -h https://nmap.org -ssl

-h https://nmap.org → Specifies the target website (https://nmap.org).

-ssl → Ensures that the scan is performed over HTTPS (though Nikto usually detects this automatically).

Purpose: Scans nmap.org over HTTPS for security vulnerabilities.



---

3. nikto -h 172.16.6.117

-h 172.16.6.117 → Specifies a local/private network IP address (172.16.6.117).

Purpose: Scans the specified IP for web server vulnerabilities.



---

4. cat > domain.txt

cat > domain.txt → Creates a file named domain.txt and waits for user input to add content.

The user will manually enter domains (e.g., scanme.nmap.org and nmap.org), then press Ctrl+D to save.

Purpose: Stores multiple domains in domain.txt for later scanning.



---

5. nikto -h domain.txt

-h domain.txt → Reads the list of domains from domain.txt and scans each one.

Purpose: Performs vulnerability scanning on multiple targets listed in domain.txt.



---

6. nikto -h nmap.org -o scan.txt

-h nmap.org → Scans nmap.org.

-o scan.txt → Saves the scan results into a file called scan.txt.

Purpose: Logs the scan output for later review.


Summary:

The commands scan individual websites (scanner.nmap.org, nmap.org) and an IP (172.16.6.117).

A file (domain.txt) is created to store multiple domains for bulk scanning.

The scan results are saved in scan.txt.
